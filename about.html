					<h3>Hi There!</h3>
					<p>
						
						Software Engineer at heart. <br>

						Born in Palermo (Italy), moved to Edinburgh for university studies, and arrived in Prague for my role as a software engineer at Microsoft. I've
						been coding since I was 14 years old,
						and programming has been a central part of my life ever since. Within the field of software
						engineering, I'm primarily interested in working with distributed systems, and complex platform infrastructure. I have experience in a variety of
						programming languages, and disciplines.
